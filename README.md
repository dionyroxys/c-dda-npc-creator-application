hi im littlenekoterra/dionyroxys, this is an open source project for cdda to create a npc creator. it can be an application or integrated with the game.

if you have any advice or wish to commit changes simply do a pull request with the desired changes. keep in mind im not a programmer. to build this ui ive used QT which you can find here https://www.qt.io/download-open-source with the Cmake build system.please understand the changes to this application will be slow however hopefully efficient

this may evolve into a larger tool in the future however, for now i wish to keep it as an NPC tool. 

this tool is being developed in my free time. if anyone with experience in reading and writing files from a ui is reading then then i ask you look at the code and see what you can do. you can find how the files roughly need to look here: https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/wiki/New-Contributor-Guide-NPCs
