if you have any advice or wish to commit changes simply do a pull request with the desired changes. keep in mind im not a programmer. to build this ui ive used QT which you can find here https://www.qt.io/download-open-source with the Cmake build system.please understand the changes to this application will be slow however hopefully efficient

this may evolve into a larger tool in the future however, for now i wish to keep it as an NPC tool.
