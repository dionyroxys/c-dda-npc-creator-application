# UICDDACC ui for C:DDA content creation

hi im littlenekoterra/dionyroxys, this is an open source project for cdda to create a npc creator. it can be an application or if the devs would like, integrated with the game. 
https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA

if you have any advice or wish to commit changes simply do a pull request with the desired changes. 
please understand the changes to this application will be slow however hopefully efficient.
there will be 2 versions of the released app, 1 with extremely commented code and 1 with no comments. 

this may evolve into a larger tool in the future however, for now i wish to keep it as an NPC tool. 

this tool is being developed in my free time. if you think you can do better than what ive done im open to pull requests, simply fork it, make the changes and do the pull. you can find info on C:DDA here: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22668796/199464311-57d985c9-47bb-4be4-8132-53e7765f2e07.png)
